# Polly-B-Gone

**Polly-B-Gone** is a 3D physics platform game that tells the story of a plucky wheeled robot named Polly, who has been imprisoned by the nefarious Dr. Nurbs in his laboratory. Polly must overcome a series of increasingly-elaborate obstacles to escape and regain her freedom.

Polly was my entry in the 2008 [CS 248](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-08/) video game competition, and she won the grand prize!

## Download

Polly-B-Gone is currently available as a binary only for Mac OS X:

* [polly-1.0.dmg.zip](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/mbostock/polly/polly-1.0.dmg.zip)

It has only been tested on 10.5 (Leopard), but it probably works on other versions. For other platforms, youâ€™ll need to build from source and make modifications as necessary.
