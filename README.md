# Polly-B-Gone

**Polly-B-Gone** is a 3D physics platform game that tells the story of a plucky wheeled robot named Polly, who has been imprisoned by the nefarious Dr. Nurbs in his laboratory. Polly must overcome a series of increasingly-elaborate obstacles to escape and regain her freedom. Polly was Mike Bostock's entry in the 2008 [CS 248](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-08/) video game competition, and it won the grand prize!

## Building on GNU/Linux

The GNU/Linux Makefile was created by Raydelto Hernandez (raydelto [at] gmail.com). It was tested un Ubuntu 20.04 on June 2020.

If you want to build this code on GNU/Linux you first need to install the following libraries:
* OpenGL
* GLEW
* GLU
* GLUT
* TinyXML
* SDL
* SDL Mixer
* SDL Image

If you are using Ubuntu you can install these libraries by typing the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev  libtinyxml-dev

```

Then , finally , build the code by running the following command
```
make
```

Finally, you can run the freshly built game running:
```
./bin/main
```
